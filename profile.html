            <p>I graduated in 2019 with a first class degree in Business Management. Whilst this enabled me to understand many traditional business models, the impact of digital and tech on the majority of sectors was of real interest to me. In my final year I joined the University marketing team, working across a number of digital campaigns, and building expertise in creative web development. As a result of this I started to teach myself HTML and CSS, gaining a wider interest in software development as this could be applied to so many fields.</p>

                <h3>Social Media and Brand Communication</h3> 
                <h3>Solent University(2018-2019)</h3>
                <p>I have gained valuable skills and experience in strategic planning for social media campaigns directed at students. To manage the social media accounts I learnt how to use the Hootsuite platform to schedule daily posts and find relevant topics relating to Solent University activities. Furthermore, I created digital media in the form of images, short videos and gifâ€™s to improve user engagement. Moreover, I was given the responsibility of creating an Instagram Solent alumna instagram account with the purpose of sharing upcoming events and achievements may bypass students. The account now has over 1000 followers and continues to grow. In addition, both the Facebook and Twitter accounts saw a 15% increase in the number of followers. Overall, this experience has been fundamental in growing my interest in digital media and web development.</p>
